# Coding-Quiz-Challenge
This is a timed coding quiz that was made with JavaScript that I created.

# Project Description
This proiect is a representation of what I learned so far when it comes to Javascript and how to utilize it to build Web APIs. Using the ReadMe that was provided for Challenge 4, I performed the following functions: 

Created a 4 question quiz that tests user knowledge of JavaScript.
Created a landing page that shares what the application is about and a button to start it. 
Created an Event Listener that corresponds to the start quiz button that will activate the timer and display questions and answers.
Created Conditional Statements to let user know if their answer choice is correct or incorrect.
Created a results page that allows user to input their name to be attached to their score and a high score page to view all scores.
Created Buttons for High Score Page that allows user to navigate back to landing page or to clear all high scores from both the webpage and local storage.
